fix airSinglePrintf to not put a space before double-type special values
("%4s" hack has to go)

----- Teem 1.6 cut-off -----

complete fprintf/sprintf/printf stand-in
complete fscanf/sscanf stand-in

arrays: make the integer function returns be more useful than just
error indication, as in, when you increment an array, return the index
of the first of the new elements now valid

Decide if air will have a general-purpose thread-safe progress indication
scheme, or if this will be each library's responsibility
